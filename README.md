# Real Estate Transaction Manager
Summary: This application will assist real estate agents (or DIY home buyers and sellers) in managing a real estate transaction from start to finish. The app will allow the user to build and edit a process map that will contain each required element of the transaction, display the due dates in an embedded Google calendar, and manage the execution of the process through “status” flags and automated notifications.  The application will utilize CRUD functionalities to interact with a back-end database that will allow creation/reading/updating/deleting of records that make up a process map in the front-end.  Additionally, the application will utilize a Google Calendar API to display transaction elements on their due dates. A desired future Phase II functionality is incorporation of automated actions (reminder emails, announcements, updates, etc.).

- front-end: ReactJS
